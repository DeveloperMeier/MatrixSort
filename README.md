Given a list of numbers such as 1, 2, 3, 4

Sort them into whole numbers by joining their parts, where the sum of
the individual groups is highest.

Example:
    ExpectedInput: java -jar MatrixSort.jar "9,4,5,6,6,9" "2"
    First Translation: List(List(9, 6), List(9,5), List(6,4))
    Second Translation List(96, 95, 64)
    Final Translation List(96, 95, 64), List(96, 95, 64).sum
